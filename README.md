# Introduction
# This app is designed to search a musician's album of the song. By typing any musician's name and click the button, you can see their album of the song. This app is using iTunes Search Api.

Our app's initial intended purpose was to find a song in apple music and allow the user to identify it in Spotify.
For future implementation, we hope to implement the Spotify API in order to query through both to allow  users to be able
convert songs from one streaming service to another.
